Build a heel sensor out of a $35 electrical component, with the [Homegrown Marine boat computer](https://github.com/HomegrownMarine/boat_computer).

I'm currently testing the BNO-055, which has built in 9-axis fusion, with the [Adafruit Breakout board](https://www.adafruit.com/products/2472).  This can also be a solid state, fast compass.
